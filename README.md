I'm a **Mobile & Fullstack Developer** with over 6 years of experience building complete ecosystems—from the app in your hand to the cloud that sustains it. My focus is on delivering software that is reliable, scalable, and solves real business problems, with critical project experience in the **fintech and payments sectors**.

I'm the kind of developer who dives deep into the business problem to ensure the technology is the solution, not a new problem.
