Guilherme here, a passionate developer with a strong foundation in self-directed learning. My background lies in game development, and I'm currently expanding my skillset  by exploring data science. I have some pratice programming with a focus on Java and C (my primary language for the past year). While I'm constantly seeking to broaden my knowledge base, I've gained valuable experience through a diverse range of personal projects and by utilizing various industry tools. I'm highly motivated to continuously learn and contribute, and I'm always eager to connect with fellow professionals in the field. Feel free to reach out!
